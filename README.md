# Emasen-a-procedural-maze-game-seeded-by-emotion

This repository contains only the Jupyter notebook python code to train the Neural network as the unreal project files and the compile executable are too large to upload.

To run Emasen one needs to go to thee following directory "WindowsNoEditor\Engine\Extras\Redist\en-us" and run "UE4PrereqSetup_x64.exe" to install prerequsites.
The Emasen executable is named "DungeonV5.exe" and is located under "WindowsNoEditor" directory.

To open the project one needs to install Unreal Engine 4.23.1
